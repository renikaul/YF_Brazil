MS_results and MS_results_revisions are two different sets of models. The revision model includes an additional covariate- vector occurance.

Within each folder results are broken into OneModel (National Model), LowModel, and HighModel for the low and high NHP species richness regions. The output includes a the model predictions, a summary of the model predictions, and the results from permutations to assess variable importance. The actual models themselves are too large to store on github. The are on the Drake lab high memory machine in 144.
