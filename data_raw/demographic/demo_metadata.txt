other notes
-Data downloaded in 2 files, 2001-2012 ref 2002 and 2010-2013 ref 2010. These datasets also included GDP per capita so I am hoping that the reference years are for population. This means that 2010,2011, and 2012 from the two sources should be identical. 
-Missing 2014 data
-Liner interpolation of yearly to monthly is TBD
